# Unified Library

Unified Library is a serverless collection of Firebase Cloud Functions designed to showcase advanced integration techniques, extensive documentation practices, and a modular code structure. This repository is a demonstration of my programming expertise—leveraging best practices in Node.js, Firebase Cloud Functions, and third-party API integrations to build a scalable, well-documented backend solution.

## Project Overview

The Unified Library repository organizes a variety of Firebase Cloud Functions into a cohesive platform that integrates with multiple third-party services. By focusing on modularity and extensive inline documentation, the repository demonstrates my commitment to writing clear, maintainable, and scalable code. Each component—from service integrations to shared utilities—is designed for easy extension and high reusability.

## Features

- **Multi-Platform Integration:** Connect seamlessly with platforms such as Zendesk, SendGrid, Zoho (Subscriptions and Books), Payliance for ACH transactions, and Google APIs (Drive and Sheets).
- **Serverless Architecture:** Built on Firebase Cloud Functions for scalable, event-driven backend operations.
- **Modular Codebase:** Each integration is encapsulated within its own module (e.g., `zendeskEndpoints`, `sendgridEndpoints`, etc.), showcasing a strong separation of concerns and a design that can evolve with future requirements.
- **Extensive Documentation:** Comprehensive inline comments and JSDoc-style documentation accompany the code, ensuring clarity in functionality, design decisions, and usage patterns.
- **Modern Tooling:** Utilizes Node.js (v20), Express for HTTP handling, and Firebase Admin SDK to ensure secure and efficient operations.
- **Configurable and Secure:** Leverages Firebase environment configurations to manage sensitive keys and runtime variables securely.
- **Extendable Design:** The repository’s structure makes it easy to add new endpoints or integrations, underlining a proactive approach to future development.

## Architecture & Modularity

The architecture is built with a strong emphasis on modularity and maintainability:

- **Entry Point (index.js):** Initializes Firebase Admin SDK with a service account key, sets up runtime variables, and exports individual modules.
- **Modular Endpoints:** Each integration (e.g., Zendesk, SendGrid, Zoho, Payliance, Google Drive/Sheets) is implemented as a separate module. This modular approach not only promotes a clear separation of concerns but also makes testing, maintenance, and expansion straightforward.
- **Shared Utilities:** Common functions, such as date calculations and delay/sleep utilities, are abstracted into shared modules. This design choice avoids duplication and reinforces the overall modular structure of the project.

## Documentation Practices

A core strength of this repository is its commitment to comprehensive documentation:

- **Inline Comments:** Every module and function is accompanied by inline comments that explain its purpose, logic, and integration points.
- **JSDoc Annotations:** Functions and modules are documented using JSDoc-style annotations, making it easier for other developers (and future me) to understand the codebase and its intended usage.
- **Clear Structure:** The README and inline documentation collectively provide a complete guide—from setup instructions to in-depth explanations of each integration module.
- **Ease of Onboarding:** The extensive documentation ensures that new contributors can quickly grasp the system's architecture, underlying patterns, and best practices.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v20 recommended)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **Firebase CLI & SDK for Node.js**
- A valid **Firebase project** (for deploying Cloud Functions)
- Service account keys and API credentials for third-party integrations

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shortyseller/unifiedLibrary.git
   cd unifiedLibrary
   ```

2. **Initialize Firebase (if not already done)**

   Attach your local installation to your Firebase project:

   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the functions directory and install all necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Before deploying or testing, ensure you set up your environment properly:

- Place your Firebase service account key in the `functions` folder as `unifiedLibraryFirebaseKey.json`.
- Use the Firebase CLI to set runtime configuration values. For example:

  ```bash
  firebase functions:config:set envvars.mySecret.dsk="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
  ```

- Securely add any additional API credentials needed for services like Zendesk, SendGrid, Zoho, and others via environment variables.

## Endpoints Overview

The repository exports several Cloud Functions endpoints that serve as bridges to various external services:

- **zendeskEndpoints:** For interacting with Zendesk support ticket management.
- **sendgridEndpoints:** For sending emails and handling inbound email parsing via SendGrid.
- **zohoSubsEndpoints:** For managing subscription operations with Zoho Subscriptions.
- **zohoBooksEndpoints:** For financial operations and invoicing with Zoho Books.
- **paylianceACHEndpoints:** For processing ACH transactions using Payliance.
- **googleDriveEndpoints:** For file management tasks with Google Drive.
- **googleSheetsEndpoints:** For manipulating data within Google Sheets.
- **pubSubScheduledFunctions:** For scheduling background tasks and incremental job processing via Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

> Note: Additional endpoints (such as generic shareable GET/POST endpoints or cloud storage integrations) are outlined in commented sections for future expansion.

## Usage

Deploy your Cloud Functions to Firebase with:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

For local testing and debugging, use the Firebase emulator:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Endpoints can be invoked via HTTPS calls or through Firebase’s callable functions, providing a versatile environment for integration testing and demonstration.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Logging & Monitoring:** Integrate structured logging and Google Cloud Monitoring for better operational insights.
- **Expanded Endpoints:** Add further third-party integrations as the project evolves.
- **Robust Testing:** Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for every module.
- **Additional Documentation:** Continuously update and expand the documentation to cover new features and integrations.
